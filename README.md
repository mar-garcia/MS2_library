# LC-MS library
This repo contains an in-house spectral library measured with the
LC-MS setup from the Metabolomics Unit of Fondazione Edmund Mach used to generate 
untargeted metabolomics data.  
  
With the following link you can see the information of the compounds included in the database, as well as their corresponding MS/MS spectras (by clicking on the corresponding `ID_M`):  
  
- [Explore Molecules](CompoundDb.html)  
- [Library statistics](stats.html)  

Compound classification is based on [ClassyFire](http://classyfire.wishartlab.com/).   
  
    
This site is inspired by the [EMBL - Metabolomics Core Facility Spectral Library](https://curatr.mcf.embl.de/).
